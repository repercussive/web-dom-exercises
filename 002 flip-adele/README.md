# Flip Adele

You will find no link here to a live demonstration. Please attempt to solve the exercise instead - you will understand why :)

## Task

`index.html` contains a perfectly normal image of Adele. Except that it is upside-down.

Make it so that the `<button id="flip-adele-button">` element causes the `<img id="adele-image">` element to rotate by 180 degrees.

When the button is clicked a second time, the image should rotate by 180 degrees again, and so forth - essentially acting as a toggle.

## Hints

- You can rotate an element via CSS with `transform: rotate()`. [Click here for more information and examples.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transform-function/rotate)

- To modify CSS from JavaScript, you can set the [style property](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/prop_html_style.asp) of any DOM element.
