## Task

Make it so that when the `<button id="eat-pizza-button">` is clicked, the `<p id="pizza">` element becomes empty. 

Additionally, the text within the `<button id="eat-pizza-button">` should change to "*No more pizza :("*

## Hints

- [`querySelector` function](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_document_queryselector.asp)

- To run code when the button is clicked, you can add an `onclick` attrbiute to the button directly from the HTML. However, it's recommended to use `addEventListener` from within `script.js` instead.
