## How to read Markdown guidance files (like this one)

You are currently reading a file called `README.md`. All files in this repository ending with `.md` are Markdown files. They all contain useful information and guidance about the exercises.

To view the rendered Markdown rather than the raw file contents, you can open the files from GitHub web interface. Alternatively, if you wish to view the files from within VS Code, you can right-click them, then click "**Open preview**":

## How to approach the exercises

Each exercise is contained within a separate folder.

Each exercise folder contains a file called `README.md`, which you should read through before starting each task. This is where you'll find out what the final product should look like.

You can then edit the project files as needed to complete each task. **The HTML and CSS code is provided for you already.** Typically, you will only need to make changes to the `script.js` file.
